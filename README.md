# Test files for internal testing

This repository contains backups of files that are used
for testing within the earthobservations repositories.

Currently, we also store the station list of Environment
and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) as a fallback backup used
by ``wetterdienst`` as their server had produced
some connection errors in recent times.
